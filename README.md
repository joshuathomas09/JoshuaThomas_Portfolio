# 👋 Hi, I'm Joshua Thomas  
Data Analyst | Data-Driven Decision Making | Transforming Insights into Impact  

<!--Section 1: Introduction-->

## 🌟 About Me  
I am a Data Analyst with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, with a strong focus on turning complex data into actionable business insights. Through academic and real-world projects, I have developed predictive models for insurance premiums, analyzed marketing campaign performance, detected fraud patterns, and created SQL-driven business insights to support strategic decisions.

Alongside my analytics experience, I worked as a Counselling Coordinator at Fair Future Overseas Educational Consultancy Pvt Ltd, where I managed structured client data, improved record systems, and increased response efficiency by 20%. This role strengthened my communication, problem-solving, and stakeholder management skills.

I completed a Postgraduate Program in Data Science and Business Analytics from University of Texas at Austin in collaboration with Great Learning, and I am eager to apply data-driven thinking to solve real-world business problems and grow as a data professional.
🚀 Let’s turn data into impactful stories!
